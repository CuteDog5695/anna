I was unable the name of the original artist of this. If you know, please ping orangc on Discord with a link to the artist.

# Anna
Anna is named after Anna Yanami from Makeine: Too Many Losing Heroines.
She is a fork of [orangcc](https://github.com/is-a-dev/orangcapp) meant to be a replacement for [Fire](https://github.com/is-a-dev/fire) and [orangcc](https://github.com/is-a-dev/orangcapp) in the is-a.dev Discord server.

## todo
